# Automated Setup with Task
This example automates the design laid out in the [architecture diagram](../.assets/architecture.png). It will create an environment similar to this [Sample Environment](../docs/example-environment.md)

## Technical Details
* The environment is built using Task.  Task is a powerful automation tool that allows you to automate tasks in a simple and easy way. 
    * To see all subcommands, run `task --list`
* The environment uses Terraform to provision the infrastructure. 
    * The terraform is split up into two components - Core Components and Runners.  
* The `task up` command will a Terraform workspace named after the desired region and provision Azure Automation and Azure Virtual Network.
* The `task packer` command will create a Golden Image for the Hybrid Workers.
    * The Golden Image is versioned by the year then the week of the year. So, the first build of the year 2023 will be 1.23.01, the second week will be version 1.23.02, and so on.
    * The Golden Image is replicated to all regions where the Hybrid Workers are required. 
    * The Golden Image is given an expiration date to ensure that it is not used after a certain period of time.Default is 14 days after creation.
    * The Golden Image has PowerShell installed
* The `task runners -- {{APP_NAME}}` command will create a Terraform workspace named based on the {{APP_NAME}} and the current date.
    * This is how to ensure that the Hybrid Workers are repaved once a week.  
    * A Tag is set on the Azure Resource Group to track the expiration date of the Hybrid Workers.  It defaults to 7 days.
    * A next time the `task runners` command is executed, it will create a new set of Hybrid Workers and destroy the old ones.
    * Another job could be created to destroy the old workers based on the expiration tag.
    * The task command reads the Azure Automation Account URL from the output of the `task up` command.
* The `task down` command will destroy the Azure Automation, Azure Virutal Machines, and the Azure Virtual Network.
* The Hybrid Workers are Ubuntu Linux with PowerShell installed.
* The SKU Type of the macines is Standard_B1s - which may be too small for production workloads. 
    * The variable `vm_sku` in the `runners/variables.tf` file can be changed to a larger size.
* An SSH key is automatically generated, passed to the Hybrid Workers, and then removed from the terraform state file to ensure that no human has interative access to the runners. 
* The number of Hybrid Workers created is based on the VM_COUNT variable in the Taskfile.yaml which is passed to the `number_of_runners` variable in the `runners/variables.tf` file.
* A simple PowerShell script (../infrastructure/runbook.tf) - which just prints out what machine executed the runbook - is added to the Azure Automation Account to test the Hybrid Workers.

## Prerequisite 
* A Linux machine or Windows Subsytem for Linux or Docker for Windows 
* Azure Cli and an Azure Subscription
* Terraform 
* [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation)
* Azure subscription with Owner access permissions

## Azure Infrastructure 
```bash
az login
task up -- southcentralus
```

### Example
```bash
$ task up
task: [up] terraform workspace new southcentralus || true
Created and switched to workspace "southcentralus"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.
task: [up] terraform workspace select southcentralus
task: [up] terraform init
