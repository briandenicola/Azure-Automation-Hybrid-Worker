# Azure Automation Hybrid Worker Demo 

## Overview 
Azure Automation is a service that allows you to automate tasks in Azure. Azure Automation allows you to run runbooks in the cloud or on-premises. It is a standard command-and-control architecture, where the Azure Automation service sends jobs to workers. The workers performs the jobs.  Sometimes these jobs require access to Azure resources that are not accessible from the public internet. In this case, you can use a Hybrid Worker. 

* A Hybrid Worker is a virtual machine that is deployed in your Azure subscription. The Hybrid Worker is registered with the Azure Automation service. 

* This demo shows how to deploy a disposalable Hybrid Workers using Terraform and Packer without any interaction with the actual virtual machines.  All software is installed via Packer in a Golden Image or via [Cloud Init](./infrastructure/runners/cloud-init.txt).

* The Hybrid Workers are registered with the Azure Automation service using the new Azure VM Extension. The traditional agent installation model required interactive login to the machine, which is not ideal.
  * The extension takes one argument - the Hybrid Service Url - which is a property of the Automation Account.
  * The new extension allows the machine to be registered with the Azure Automation service without any interaction with the actual virtual machines. 
  * Please see [Azure Automation Hybrid Worker Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-hybrid-runbook-worker#benefits-of-extension-based-user-hybrid-workers) for more information around the benefits of the extension model.

* The machines are also registered with Azure Update Manager when an existing Patching schedule is already defined.

* The machines are assigned an Identity and a role assignment is created to allow the Hybrid Worker to access Azure resources. 

* The each deployment creates a unique resource group based on random id. Virtual Machines are given a random id based on the resource group id and another unique id.

* An Expiration tags is defined that will used to destory the resources after a certain period of time.

* The Hybrid Workers are intended to be repaved once a week. This demo does so by having Task create a Terraform workspace based on today's date. When executed, Task will create new machiens for the Hybrid Worker Group then clean up any hybrid workers from the previous week.

* Since a Hybrid Worker needs to have many depedencies installed, it is best to create a Golden Image and stored in Shared Image Gallery.

## Components

Azure Automation | Automation Account for Runbooks 
Azure Virtual Machine | Hybrid Workers
Azure Virtual Network | Virtual Network for Hybrid Workers
Azure Shared Image Gallery | Golden Image for Hybrid Workers
Azure Update Management | Patching for Hybrid Workers

## Pros and Cons of Hybrid Worker vs Other Job Schedulers in Azure
Pros   | Cons
------ | ------
Azure Automation can run any existing Python or PowerShell Script without (any?) customizatoins | Machines still must be managed and patched.  Azure Update Manager can assist and does not require interactive login to the machine.
Extension based automically updates when new versions are released | VM based model does not automatically scale out.  Requires an execution of the Terraform command to create additional workers.
Azure Automation provides a built in Python and PowerShell module repository | Azure Container Apps Jobs require each job/script to provide all dependencies in the container image. 
Does not execute Containres easily | Azure Container Apps Jobs executes containers automatically and can scale out using event triggers.
Azure Automation integrated with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics | Azure Container Apps Jobs integrated with Azure Monitor and Log Analytics |
Azure Automation schedules jobs by Cron syntax | Azure Container Apps Jobs schedules jobs by Cron syntax 
Azure Automation has extensive logging and auditing | Azure Container Apps Jobs has some degreee of logging and auditing

## Examlple Setup
* The following is a example of [deployment](./docs/setup.md) using [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
